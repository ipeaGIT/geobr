\usage{
read_health_facilities(code)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{The 7-digit code of a municipality. If the two-digit code or a two-letter 
abbreviation of a state is passed, (e.g. 33 or "RJ") the function will load all healthcare
facilities of that state. If code="all", all facilities of the country are loaded.}

\description{
Data comes from the National Registry of Healthcare facilities (Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saúde - CNES),
originally collected by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The date of the last data update is 
registered in the database in the columns ‘date_update’ and ‘year_update’. These data uses Geodetic reference 
system "SIRGAS2000" and CRS(4674). The coordinates of each facility was obtained by CNES 
and validated by means of space operations. These operations verify if the point is in the 
municipality, considering a radius of 5,000 meters. When the coordinate is not correct, 
further searches are done in other systems of the Ministry of Health and in web services 
like Google Maps . Finally, if the coordinates have been correctly obtained in this process,
the coordinates of the municipal head office are used. The final source used is registered 
in the database in a specific column ‘data_source’. Periodically the coordinates are revised 
with the objective of improving the quality of the data. More information 
available at http://dados.gov.br/dataset/cnes
