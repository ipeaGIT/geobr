# geobr dev
# geobr v1.9.1999999999 dev

- Now all functions download data from the latest year available, by default.
- Fix url redundancy to avoid internet connection problems.
**New data**


- neighborhoods 2022
- updated census tracts for 2022


# geobr v1.9.1


**Minor changes**

- The `read_municipality()` has a new parameter `keep_areas_operacionais`, which allows users to control wether the data should keep the polygons of Lagoas dos Patos and Lagoa Mirim in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (considered as areas estaduais operacionais). The default `FALSE` drops these two polygons. Closes #176.
- Functions now include a `cache` parameter that allows users to decide whehter to keep files in cache or to force downloading them again. At the moment, files are only cached during the R session, but this is a step towards a future version of {geobr} when files  will be based on permanent caching.
- Now using `curl::multi_download()` to download files in parallel
- Removed dependency on the {httr} package
- {geobr} now imports {fs} to use robust cross-platform file system operations
- Simplified and streamlined internal functions




# geobr v1.9.0

**Major changes**

- Function `read_health_facilities()` now has a new parameter `date`, which will allow users to access data for different dates of reference. The plan is to have at least one update of this data set per year. Closes #334.
- Functions `read_urban_area()` and `read_metro_area()` now have a new parameter `code_state`, which will allow users to filter selected states. Closes #338

**Bug fix**

- Using `data.table::rbindlist()` to rind data was throwing errors when some observations were of class `POLYGONS` and others were `MULTIPOLYGONS`. This has now been replaced with `dplyr::bind_rows()` at a very small performance penalty. Closes #346.

**New data**

- schools for 2023
- health facilities for 202303
- census tracts for 2020 and 2022


# geobr v1.8.2 

**CRAN request**

- Fixed issue to make sure geobr uses suggested packages conditionally

**Minor changes**

- Fixed non-ASCII characters in data `geobr::grid_state_correspondence_table()`



# geobr v1.8.1

**CRAN request**

- geobr now uses suggested packages conditionally



# geobr v1.8.0

**New function**

- `read_capitals()` to download either a spatial `sf` object with the location of the municipal seats (sede dos municipios) of state capitals, or a `data.frame` with the names of codes of state capitals. [Closes #243](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/243)

**Minor changes**

- Update intro vignette to show how to use geobr together with the new [**censobr**](https://ipeagit.github.io/censobr/index.html) sister package.

**Bug fixes**

- fixed bug from conflict between `sf` and `data.table` that was messing with plot extent. [Closes #284](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/284).
- fixed bug from conflicts between `plotly` and `data.table`. [Closes #279](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/279).
- fixed bug in `cep_to_state()` function. [Closes #317](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/317).
- fixed bug in progress bar. [Closes #154](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/154).
- The `lookup_muni()` and `download_metadata()` functions are now more robust to internet connection failures.


# geobr v1.7.0

**Major changes**

- All data sets are now simultaneously stored on github and on Ipea's server. The package first tries to download the data from Ipea's server. In case Ipea's link is off line for some reason, then the package tries to download the data from github. For users, the effect of this change is that the package is much more stable and less vulnerable to instabilities in data server connection.

**Minor changes**

- Started using package documentation templates with Roxygen
- Reduced a lot of code redundancy
- Important update tothe `check_connection()` function





# geobr v1.6.6

**Major changes**

- New argument `showProgress` to display progress bar. Defaults to `TRUE`
- Argument `tp` was deprecated and replaced by argument `simplified` that needs to be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This should only affect user who have previously used `tp=TRUE`, who now should write `simplified=FALSE`

**Minor changes**

- reorganization of internal support functions to reduce code redundancy
- substantial improvment in test coverage of functions
- substantial improvment in test coverage of functions
- modified package tests using new format of `crs` objects. Following `sf` package update `v0.9-0`



# geobr v1.2 (2020-02-20)

**New data sets/functions**

- data set `read_metro_area` to read official metropolitan areas - closes issue #2 (added in 2019-12).

**Major changes**

- MAJOR change of `geobr` to read `geopackage` files, instead of `.rds`. A structural change that will make it easier to maintain both versions of geobr in R and Python  (2020-02)

- Pretty much all functions now download the data for the entire country as a default. Closes issue #77. The only exceptions are `read_statistical_grid` and `read_census_tract`. These two functions do take a really long time to load the data for the whole country and it might crash R due to memory limits, so the user must be more 'aware' about her choice (2020-02)
