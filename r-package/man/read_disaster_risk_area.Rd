\title{Download spatial data of disaster risk areas}
\usage{
read_disaster_risk_area(year = 2010, simplified = TRUE, showProgress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Numeric. Year of the data in YYYY format. Defaults to \code{2010}.}

\item{simplified}{Logic \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE}, indicating whether the function
should return the data set with 'original' spatial resolution or a data set
with 'simplified' geometry. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. For spatial analysis and
statistics users should set \code{simplified = FALSE}. Borders have been
simplified by removing vertices of borders using \verb{st_simplify\{sf\}} preserving
topology with a \code{dTolerance} of 100.}

\item{showProgress}{Logical. Defaults to \code{TRUE} display progress bar.}
}
\value{
An \verb{"sf" "data.frame"} object
}
\description{
This function reads the the official data of disaster risk areas in Brazil.
It specifically focuses on geodynamic and hydro-meteorological disasters
capable of triggering landslides and floods. The #' data set covers the whole
country. Each risk area polygon (known as 'BATER') has unique code id (column
'geo_bater'). The data set brings information on the extent to which the risk
area polygons overlap with census tracts and block faces (column "acuracia")
and number of ris areas within each risk area (column 'num'). Original data
were generated by IBGE and CEMADEN. For more information about the methodology,
see deails at \url{https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/organizacao-do-territorio/tipologias-do-territorio/21538-populacao-em-areas-de-risco-no-brasil.html}
