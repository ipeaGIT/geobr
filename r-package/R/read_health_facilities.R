#' Download geolocated data of health facilities
#'
#' @description
#' Data comes from the National Registry of Healthcare facilities (Cadastro
#' Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saude - CNES), originally collected by the
#' Brazilian Ministry of Health. According to the Ministry of Health: "The
#' coordinates of each facility were obtained by CNES and validated by means of
#' space operations. These operations verify if the point is in the municipality,
#' considering a radius of 5,000 meters. When the coordinate is not correct,
#' further searches are done in other systems of the Ministry of Health and in
#' web services like Google Maps. Finally, if the coordinates have been correctly
#' obtained in this process, the coordinates of the municipal head office are
#' used. The geocode source used is registered in the database in a specific
#' column `data_source`. Periodically the coordinates are revised with the
#' objective of improving the quality of the data." The date of the last data
#' update is registered in the database in the columns `date_update` and
#' `year_update`. More information in the CNES data set available at \url{https://dados.gov.br/}.
#' These data use Geodetic reference system "SIRGAS2000" and CRS(4674).
