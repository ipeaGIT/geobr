# Download geolocated data of schools

Data comes from the School Census and Catalogue of Schools, organized by
the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research Anisio
Teixeira (INEP). More information available at
<https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/inep-data/catalogo-de-escolas/>.
The spatial coordinates used in geobr are a combination of the
coordinates produced by the original data producer and the coordinates
found via geocoding with the geocodebr package
<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geocodebr>. Whenever the distance
between the coordinates from both sources is smaller than 800 meters,
geobr uses coordinates from the data producer. When the distance between
the two sources is greater than 800 meters and the results from
geocodebr have a precision level finer than 800 meters, geobr uses the
coordinates from geocodebr. When the coordinates from the original
source are missing, geobr also uses geocodebr coordinates, regardless of
precision level. The source of the spatial coordinates used in each
observation is registered in the data in a specific column
`coords_source`. Additional columns indicating the precision level of
geocodebr geocoding are also included in the data.

## Usage

``` r
read_schools(
  year,
  code_muni = "all",
  output = "sf",
  showProgress = TRUE,
  cache = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- year:

  Numeric. Year of the data in YYYY format. It defaults to `NULL` and
  reads the data from the latest year available.

- code_muni:

  The 7-digit code of a municipality. If `code_muni = "all"` (Default),
  the function downloads all the data available in the country.
  Alternatively, if a two-digit state code or a two-letter uppercase
  abbreviation of a state is passed (e.g. `33` or `"RJ"`), all data of
  that state are downloaded. Municipality codes can be consulted with
  the
  [`geobr::lookup_muni()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/lookup_muni.md)
  function.

- output:

  String. Type of object returned by the function. Defaults to `"sf"`,
  which loads the data into memory as an sf object. Alternatively,
  `"duckdb"` returns a lazy spatial table backed by DuckDB via the
  duckspatial package, and `"arrow"` returns an Arrow dataset. Both
  `"duckdb"` and `"arrow"` support out-of-memory processing of large
  data sets.

- showProgress:

  Logical. Defaults to `TRUE` display progress bar.

- cache:

  Logical. Whether the function should read the data cached locally,
  which is faster. Defaults to `cache = TRUE`. By default, `geobr`
  stores data files in a temporary directory that exists only within
  each R session. If `cache = FALSE`, the function will download the
  data again and overwrite the local file.

- verbose:

  A logical. If `TRUE` (the default), the function prints informative
  messages and shows download progress bar. If `FALSE`, the function is
  silent.

## Value

An `"sf" "data.frame"` OR an `ArrowObject`

## Examples

``` r
# Read all schools in the country
s <- read_schools(year = 2020)
#> ℹ Using year/date 2020

# Read all schools in a given state
s <- read_schools(
  year = 2020,
  code_muni = "AC"
  )
#> ℹ Using year/date 2020

# Read all schools in a given municipality
s <- read_schools(
  year = 2020,
  code_muni = 1200401
  )
#> ℹ Using year/date 2020
```
