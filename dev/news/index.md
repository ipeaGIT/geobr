  to remove islands from Brazil. Closes
  [\#412](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/412).

**Breaking changes**

- The `year` and `date` arguments can no longer be `NULL`; they must be
  explicitly specified. This change is intentional and is meant to
  encourage users to be more mindful of historical changes in the data.
- The `geom` column has been renamed to `geometry` for consistency
- The
  [`read_health_region()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_health_region.md)
  has been completely rewritten to allow users return more detailed
  output if needed
- Functions like
  [`read_schools()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_schools.md)
  and
  [`read_health_facilities()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_health_facilities.md)
  now use a combination of official spatial coordinates and coordinates
  found using the [{geocodebr}](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geocodebr/)
  package to improve spatial accuracy. See documentation of these
  functions.
- The function
  [`lookup_muni()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/lookup_muni.md)
  now has a `year` parameter. Closes
  [\#401](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/401).
- The function and data
  [`read_comparable_areas()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_comparable_areas.md)
  will be going under major changes. For now, this function is
  temporarily suspended.
- The only year available so far for the functions
  [`read_urban_concentrations()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_urban_concentrations.md)
  and
  [`read_pop_arrangements()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_pop_arrangements.md)is
  2010, and not 2015.

**Major changes**

- Data files are now saved in `.parquet`. This improved performance to
  download and to read files, and allow integration with gearrow. Closes
  [\#290](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/news/)
- Most functions have a new argument `output`, which allow users to
  choose whether functions should return an `"sf"` to memory (default)
  or an `"arrow"` table.
- All functions have a new argument `verbose`. If `TRUE` (the default),
  the function prints informative messages and shows download progress
  bar. If `FALSE`, the function is silent. Closes
  [\#400](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/400).
- The function
  [`list_geobr()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/list_geobr.md)
  now has a boolean argument `wide`, so users can choose whether the
  output should be presented in wide or long format.
- The function
  [`lookup_muni()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/lookup_muni.md)
  now uses probabilistic match to find municipality names that users
  might input with typos. Closes
  [\#406](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/406).
- The following functions now include the column `code_state` to allow
  users to filter the data directly in the function call:
  [`read_indigenous_land()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_indigenous_land.md),
  [`read_metro_area()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_metro_area.md),
  [`read_pop_arrangements()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_pop_arrangements.md)
  and
  [`read_urban_concentrations()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_urban_concentrations.md).
- The following functions now include the column `code_muni` to allow
  users to filter the data directly in the function call:
  [`read_disaster_risk_area()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_disaster_risk_area.md),
  [`read_health_facilities()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_health_facilities.md),
  `read_neighborhood`(),
  [`read_statistical_grid()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_statistical_grid.md)
  and
  [`read_schools()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_schools.md).

## geobr v1.9.1

CRAN release: 2024-09-06

**Minor changes**

- The
  [`read_municipality()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_municipality.md)
  has a new parameter `keep_areas_operacionais`, which allows users to
  control wether the data should keep the polygons of Lagoas dos Patos
  and Lagoa Mirim in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (considered as areas
  estaduais operacionais). The default `FALSE` drops these two polygons.
  Closes [\#176](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/176).
- Functions now include a `cache` parameter that allows users to decide
  whehter to keep files in cache or to force downloading them again. At
  the moment, files are only cached during the R session, but this is a
  step towards a future version of {geobr} when files will be based on
  permanent caching.
- Now using
  [`curl::multi_download()`](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/curl/reference/multi_download.html)
  to download files in parallel
- Removed dependency on the {httr} package
- {geobr} now imports {fs} to use robust cross-platform file system
  operations
- Simplified and streamlined internal functions

## geobr v1.9.0

CRAN release: 2024-04-18

**Major changes**

- Function
  [`read_health_facilities()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_health_facilities.md)
  now has a new parameter `date`, which will allow users to access data
  for different dates of reference. The plan is to have at least one
  update of this data set per year. Closes
  [\#334](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/334).
- Functions
  [`read_urban_area()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_urban_area.md)
  and
  [`read_metro_area()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/read_metro_area.md)
  now have a new parameter `code_state`, which will allow users to
  filter selected states. Closes
  [\#338](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/338)

**Bug fix**

- Using
  [`data.table::rbindlist()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/data.table/man/rbindlist.html)
  to rind data was throwing errors when some observations were of class
  `POLYGONS` and others were `MULTIPOLYGONS`. This has now been replaced
  with
  [`dplyr::bind_rows()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/bind_rows.html)
  at a very small performance penalty. Closes
  [\#346](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/346).

**New data**

- schools for 2023
- health facilities for 202303
- census tracts for 2020 and 2022

- The
  [`lookup_muni()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/geobr/dev/reference/lookup_muni.md)
  and `download_metadata()` functions are now more robust to internet
  connection failures.

## geobr v1.7.0

CRAN release: 2022-08-16

**Major changes**

- All data sets are now simultaneously stored on github and on Ipea’s
  server. The package first tries to download the data from Ipea’s
  server. In case Ipea’s link is off line for some reason, then the
  package tries to download the data from github. For users, the effect
  of this change is that the package is much more stable and less
  vulnerable to instabilities in data server connection.

**Minor changes**

- substantial improvment in test coverage of functions
- substantial improvment in test coverage of functions
- modified package tests using new format of `crs` objects. Following
  `sf` package update `v0.9-0`

## geobr v1.2 (2020-02-20)

CRAN release: 2020-02-20

**New data sets/functions**

- data set `read_metro_area` to read official metropolitan areas -
  closes issue [\#2](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/2) (added
  in 2019-12).
- data set `read_municipal_seat` to read the spatial coordinates of
  municipal seats- closes issue
  [\#86](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/86) (added in 2019-12).
- function `lookup_muni` to look up municipality codes by their name, or

  Closes issue [\#57](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/57).

**Major changes**

- MAJOR change of `geobr` to read `geopackage` files, instead of `.rds`.
  A structural change that will make it easier to maintain both versions
  of geobr in R and Python (2020-02)
- All functions now have an additional argument `tp` as in data ‘type’.
  This argument defaults to read data sets with ‘simplified’ borders,
  what makes the package much more efficient for downloading and
  plotting the data. Closes issue
  [\#76](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/76) (2020-02)
- Pretty much all functions now download the data for the entire country
  as a default. Closes issue
  [\#77](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/77). The only
  exceptions are `read_statistical_grid` and `read_census_tract`. These
  two functions do take a really long time to load the data for the
  whole country and it might crash R due to memory limits, so the user
  must be more ‘aware’ about her choice (2020-02)

**Minor changes**

- New utils.R script containing support functions to reduce code
  redundancy (2020-02)

## geobr v1.1

- function `download_metadata` simply the download of df with data set
  addresses.

**Minor changes**

- Changes to `read_region` function to improve speed and remove
  `dplyr`dependency (added in 2019-10-22).
- Shows a single download progress bar when `*_code="all"`. This fixes
  the output of vignette and closes issue
  [\#42](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues/42) (2019-08-05)
